# Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software

This course is offered at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/in) by Duke University.
This is an Java specialization course. [Link to the course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming/home/welcome)

## BlueJ IDE 
Some of the codes can be run in a custom BlueJ Development Environment or any other IDE. We are provided by BlueJ IDE made by Duke University especially for this course. The IDE is provided in the Univerity and the link to it is [here](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2)

## Certificate
I completed this course in a month. The [link to the certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CN7wRiHNkIGu2MsJLriEV3KF7hh_uTxe/view) is here.

## What I learned from the Course and The Seven Step Approach
1. Work Example By Hand
      1.Solve small instance by hand    
      2.Unclear problem?     
      3.Need domain knowledge?    
   
2. Write Down What You Did
    >Write down exact steps
    >Just that instance
    >Tricky: do without thinking
3. Find Patterns
    >Algorithm for any instance
    >Find patterns
    >Repetition, conditions, values
    >Difficulties?
        <>Try step 1 + 2 again
        <>Different inputs
4. Check By Hand
    >Incorrect pattern? Find now
    >Check with different inputs
5. Translating To Code
    >Programming language
6. Run Test Cases
    >Run test cases on code
    >Check anwser
7. Debug Failed Test Cases
    >Test failed? Debug
      <>Use scientific method
      <>Understand problem + fix
    >Algorithm problem?
      <>Return to step 3 and fix the algorithm
    >Implementation problem?
      <>Return to step 5 and correct the translation of the algorithm to code
